# VerHorLine-Shader
Cinema 4D Shader to create lines


Sometimes we just need a simple line as a texture for a material./n
And that line could be vertical or horizontal./n
And in any location.

And any width.

And with any smoothness.

This is exactly what this plugin shader does.

And it is fully commented, so you can see how it works and, maybe, start implementing your own plugin shaders.
